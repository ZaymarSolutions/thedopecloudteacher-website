# Monetization & Execution Plan

You’re sitting on a lot of leverage already: high-value skills, 3 branded platforms, and strong niches (cloud + AI + wellness). Here’s how to turn those into near-term cash without new spending.

## 1. Clarify Your Money Target
- How much extra do you want per month (e.g., +$2k, +$5k)?
- How many focused hours per week can you realistically give outside the Microsoft contract and school (5, 10, 15)?
- Do you want fast cash (done-for-you services) or more scalable income (courses, products, memberships)?

## 2. CloudShiftPro.org: Premium, Small “Wins” Services
- Offer tightly-scoped, fast-to-deliver services (e.g., cloud bill slash, Azure landing zone check, AI add-on for existing apps).
- Example pricing: $750–$3,000 depending on scope.
- Use LinkedIn and tech communities for outreach.

## 3. TheDopeCloudTeacHer.org: High-Ticket Teaching & Cohorts
- Run live cohort programs (e.g., “Get your first Azure role in 8 weeks”).
- Charge $397–$597 per seat; offer 1:1 coaching for $600–$1,000.
- Use homepage, social, and partnerships for promotion.

## 4. AskDoGood.com: Low-Ticket, Recurring & Upsell Engine
- Launch digital wellness products ($17–$37), offer paid consults ($97–$197).
- Use email list and cross-brand funneling.

## 5. Leverage Your W-2 Contract
- Use your title for credibility, keep your resume ready, dedicate fixed weekly time blocks for business growth.

## 6. 60-Day Execution Map
- **Weeks 1–2:** Set goals, launch a micro-offer, create a digital product, update LinkedIn.
- **Weeks 3–4:** Launch cohort waitlist, post on socials, DM network.
- **Weeks 5–8:** Run cohort, book audits/consults, tune offers.
